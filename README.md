#Database Design
1. Users
Represents individuals who can either host properties or make bookings.

id – Unique identifier

name – Full name of the user

email – User’s email (unique)

password_hash – Encrypted password

role – e.g., guest or host

 Relationships:

A user can list multiple properties (as a host).

A user can make multiple bookings (as a guest).

A user can write multiple reviews.

2. Properties
Represents accommodations listed by hosts.

id – Unique identifier

user_id – Foreign key (host who listed the property)

title – Property title

description – Detailed description

price_per_night – Cost per night

 Relationships:

Each property is owned by one user.

A property can have many bookings.

A property can have many reviews.

3. Bookings
Represents reservations made by users for properties.

id – Unique identifier

user_id – Foreign key (guest making the booking)

property_id – Foreign key (property being booked)

start_date – Check-in date

end_date – Check-out date

 Relationships:

A booking is made by one user for one property.

A booking may result in a payment.

4. Reviews
Represents feedback left by users after a stay.

id – Unique identifier

user_id – Foreign key (author of the review)

property_id – Foreign key (property being reviewed)

rating – Score (e.g., 1 to 5)

comment – Text feedback

 Relationships:

A user can leave multiple reviews.

Each review is associated with one property.

5. Payments
Represents transactions for confirmed bookings.

id – Unique identifier

booking_id – Foreign key (associated booking)

amount – Payment amount

payment_method – e.g., credit card, PayPal

status – e.g., pending, completed

 Relationships:

Each payment is linked to one booking.

#Feature Breakdown
 User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely. The system supports two roles: guests (who book properties) and hosts (who list properties), each with access to role-specific functionalities.

 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings, including details like photos, descriptions, and pricing. This enables hosts to manage their offerings and attract bookings.

 Booking System
Guests can browse properties, select available dates, and make bookings. This feature handles availability checks, booking logic, and prevents overlapping reservations.

 Payment Integration
Secure payments are processed for each confirmed booking using simulated or real payment gateways. This ensures a streamlined transaction process between guests and hosts.

 Reviews and Ratings
After a completed stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This builds trust and helps other users make informed decisions when booking.

 Search and Filters
Users can search properties by location, date, price, and other filters. This improves discoverability and helps users find suitable accommodations quickly.

#API Security
 Authentication
We will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for secure login sessions. Only authenticated users can access protected endpoints, ensuring identity verification before granting access to any user-related functionality.

 Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive actions like booking or property listing.

 Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will ensure users can only perform actions appropriate to their roles (e.g., only hosts can add properties, only guests can book).

 Why it matters: Keeps the system secure and prevents users from accessing or manipulating data that doesn't belong to them.

 Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common attacks.

 Why it matters: Ensures the system only processes clean, expected data and protects the database from malicious queries.

 Rate Limiting
Rate limiting and throttling will be implemented to prevent abuse of endpoints (e.g., brute-force login attempts or spammy API calls).

 Why it matters: Protects against DoS attacks and system overload by limiting the number of requests a user/IP can make in a given time.

 HTTPS Encryption
All API communication will occur over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit between clients and servers.

 Why it matters: Ensures sensitive information like passwords and payment details cannot be intercepted by attackers.

 Secure Payments
If real payment gateways are used, secure APIs (e.g., Stripe, PayPal SDKs) will be integrated and tokenized to avoid storing raw payment data on our servers.

 Why it matters: Payment security is critical for protecting financial data and building user trust.

#CI/CD Pipeline
 Why CI/CD is Important:
Automated Testing: Ensures new code doesn't break existing functionality.

Faster Deployment: New features and bug fixes can be released more frequently and reliably.

Improved Collaboration: Teams can merge code more easily with automated checks and feedback.

Consistency: The same deployment process is used every time, reducing the chance of "it works on my machine" issues.

 Tools We May Use:
GitHub Actions: Automates tasks like testing, linting, and deployment on every push or pull request.

Docker: Packages the app into containers, ensuring consistent environments for development, testing, and production.

Heroku / Vercel / Netlify: For automated deployment of frontend or backend services.

Postman/Newman: For running automated API tests during CI stages.

 Typical Workflow:

Developer pushes code to GitHub.

GitHub Actions triggers automated tests and linting.

If tests pass, the app is built and deployed via Docker or to a cloud platform.

Feedback is provided automatically via pull request checks.
